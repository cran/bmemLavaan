Description: Methods for mediation analysis with missing data and non-normal data are implemented. For missing data, four methods are available: Listwise deletion, Pairwise deletion, Multiple imputation, and Two Stage Maximum Likelihood algorithm. For MI and TS-ML, auxiliary variables can be included to handle missing data. For handling non-normal data, bootstrap and two-stage robust methods can be used. Technical details of the methods can be found in Zhang and Wang (2013, <doi:10.1007/s11336-012-9301-5>), Zhang (2014, <doi:10.3758/s13428-013-0424-0>), and Yuan and Zhang (2012, <doi:10.1007/s11336-012-9282-4>).
